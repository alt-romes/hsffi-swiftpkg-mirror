# hsffi-swiftpkg-mirror
Distributes the subdirectory haskell-ffi from haskell-swift repository as a package because Package.swift must be in the root. See [haskell-swift](https://github.com/alt-romes/haskell-swift) instead!

This repository serves only to distribute the Swift package that is developed at [haskell-swift](https://github.com/alt-romes/haskell-swift) and is automatically kept up to date with a script within that repo.
